# Learning-Pygame

A Simple Game designed with PyGame to study the library, based upon this video from Tech With Tim (https://youtu.be/jO6qQDNa2UY)

However, I've added a countdown when the game ends, indicating how long it will take to reset the game, also planning to make some portability changes to different monitors

Preview of the Game:
